 Wrong Answer. !!!Wrong Answer

Possibly your code doesn't work correctly for multiple test-cases (TCs).

The first test case where your code failed:

Input:
3 4 N 2 7 N 2 1 N 9 1

Its Correct output is:
3 4 2 2 9

And Your Code's output is:
3 4 2
 
 void leftView(Node root)
    {
        System.out.print(root.data+" ");
        if(root.left!=null){
            leftView(root.left);
        }
        return;
    }
